##Why Victor?
Learning from a mom who has chronic disease, like rheumatoid arthritis, I know it is sometime very difficult to keep up with your medication everyday. So I wanted to develop a application to help people who needs to take medication. I also want to bring the medical provider and the patients together, using technology we have to create a better medical service. 

##The Approach
Victor is designed based on MedisafeÂ®, Medisafe is the leading personalized medication management platform helping patients stay on top of all their medications. I adapted and modeled the design and functionality of my application on what is available on the Medisafe mobile app.
