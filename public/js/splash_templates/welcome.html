        When I was first diagnosed with HIV,
        the thought of taking daily medication and having to maintain a strict adherence to that seemed overwhelming,
        as I’m not someone that likes to take pills. But, with the help of Victor, it’s much easier.

      I am on numerous medications for RA; "Victor" has helped me keep everything in order,
      I never miss a medication and can add new ones as they are needed.
      So easy to set up and I have all medications at my fingertips when needed for doctor visits!!!

      I take a total of 12 pills a day, at three different times PER day.
      Victor keeps me up to date.
      I can also take note and connect with my medical provider thru the app.
      Managing chronic illnesses can be tough but Victor makes it easier!
